    <!-- The display uses different gamma curves for different refresh rates. It's hard for panel
         vendors to tune the curves to have exact same brightness for different refresh rate. So
         flicker could be observed at switch time. The issue is worse at the gamma lower end.
         In addition, human eyes are more sensitive to the flicker at darker environment.
         To prevent flicker, we only support higher refresh rates if the display brightness is above
         a threshold.
         For example, no higher refresh rate if
             display brightness <= disp0 && ambient brightness <= amb0
             || display brightness <= disp1 && ambient brightness <= amb1 -->

    <!-- The bounding path of the cutout region of the main built-in display.
         Must either be empty if there is no cutout region, or a string that is parsable by
         {@link android.util.PathParser}.
         The path is assumed to be specified in display coordinates with pixel units and in
         the display's native orientation, with the origin of the coordinate system at the
         center top of the display. Optionally, you can append either `@left` or `@right` to the
         end of the path string, in order to change the path origin to either the top left,
         or top right of the display.
         To facilitate writing device-independent emulation overlays, the marker `@dp` can be
         appended after the path string to interpret coordinates in dp instead of px units.
         Note that a physical cutout should be configured in pixels for the best results.
         Example for a 10px x 10px square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z</string>
         Example for a 10dp x 10dp square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z @dp</string>
